                The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway in Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu, India, built by the British in 1908.[1] The railway is operated by the Southern Railway[2] and is the only rack railway in India.

                The railway relies on its fleet of steam locomotives.[3] NMR switched to diesel locomotives on the section between Mettupalyam and Udhagamandalam. Local people and visitors led a campaign to return to steam locomotives in this section.[3]
                
                In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The site then became known as Mountain Railways of India

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>In 1854, plans were made to build a mountain railway from Mettupalayam to the Nilgiri Hills. However, it took the decision-makers 45 years to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and complete the construction. The line was completed and opened for traffic in June 1899. It was operated first by the Madras Railway under an agreement with the government.

                The Madras Railway Company continued to manage the railway line on behalf of the government for a long time until the South Indian Railway company purchased it.
                
                In 1907, the railway received four Double Fairlie locomotives to work the line. These were part of a batch built by the Avonside Engine Company in 1879 and 1880 for service in Afghanistan, but had been in store since 1887.[6] The Fairlies continued in use until at least 1914.[7]
                
                In September 1908, the line was extended to Fernhill. By 15 October 1908, it was extended to Udagmandalam. These extensions from Coonoor on the same gauge over a distance of 11+3⁄4 miles (18.91 km) were done at a cost of ₹ 2,440,000.</p>
